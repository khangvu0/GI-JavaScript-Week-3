# GI-JavaScript-Week-3

This repository contains my solutions to the JavaScript challenges from Week 3 â€“ Guided Inquiry: JavaScript. Unlike previous projects, this assignment focused purely on core JavaScript concepts and logic, with all interaction occurring through the console (no HTML or CSS involved). These exercises were designed to deepen my understanding of closures, functions, objects, prototypal inheritance, and ES6+ features.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the website [here](https://gi-java-script-week-3.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

-   JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

-   Gained deeper insight into JavaScript closures and how they enable data encapsulation.
-   Strengthened understanding of prototype chains and inheritance patterns.
-   Improved confidence with ES6+ syntax, especially class structures and modern array methods.
-   Practiced precision in formatting output using string interpolation and .toFixed().
-   Explored ES6 methods using arrow functions for concise syntax and proper this binding.
-   Used ES6 getters and setters to control access to object properties cleanly.
-   Implemented class and extends to create inheritance hierarchies between Person and Programmer.
-   Used constructors to initialize object properties in class instances.
-   Learned to use super() inside constructors, ensuring proper chaining of base class initialization.
-   Gained clarity on the relationship between class, constructor, constructor arguments, and this context.
-   Built foundational knowledge of class components in JavaScript for organizing object-oriented code.
-   Defined arrow functions within a class to retain lexical this binding, especially in methods passed as callbacks.
